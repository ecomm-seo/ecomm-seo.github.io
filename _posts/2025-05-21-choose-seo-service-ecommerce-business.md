Pre-optimization ensures your new offerings start off strong in search visibility.

## How to Vet SEO Providers

SEO is a long-term investment. Quick-fix promises often involve black-hat techniques.

Don’t focus only on content and keywords. Technical SEO is critical for ecommerce success.

A majority of ecommerce traffic comes from mobile devices. Make sure your SEO provider prioritizes mobile performance.
